### Kirby Neubau

A minimalist, opinionated Kirby Plainkit version. Mostly similar to the [Kirby Plainkit](https://github.com/getkirby/plainkit) with a few adjustments to spare time when starting a new project.

---

### Create

Use this template via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) with the command

```
composer create-project linusrogge/kirby-neubau
```

or, alternatively, clone the repository and run

```
composer install
```

### Install

Then open the folder and run

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

and

```
npm install
```

Now you are ready to start the development server with `composer start` and `npm run watch`.
